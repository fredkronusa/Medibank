Counting Minutes
Using JavaScript, have the function CountingMinutes(str) take the str parameter being passed which will be two times (each properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between the two times. The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320. Using TDD practices, first write the test, then code the functionality. Tests must be descriptive and pass/fail as appropriate.
 
Pattern Chaser
Using the JavaScript language, have the function PatternChaser(str) take str which will be a string and return the longest pattern within the string. A pattern for this challenge will be defined as: if at least 2 or more adjacent characters within the string repeat at least twice. So for example "aabecaa" contains the pattern aa, on the other hand "abbbaac" doesn't contain any pattern. Your program should return yes/no pattern/null. So if str were "aabejiabkfabed" the output should be yes abe. If str were "123224" the output should return no null. The string may either contain all characters (a through z only), integers, or both. But the parameter will always be a string type. The maximum length for the string being passed in will be 20 characters. If a string for example is "aa2bbbaacbbb" the pattern is "bbb" and not "aa". You must always return the longest pattern possible. Using TDD practices, first write the test, then code the functionality. Tests must be descriptive and pass/fail as appropriate.
